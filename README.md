# Scout

Scout is a Visual Studio extension for discovering and inserting Code Contracts into C# programs. It works by observing a program execution, generating likely properties, and providing an interface for inserting those properties as Code Contracts into the source code.

The repository is located on Bitbucket: https://bitbucket.org/fmc3/scout
